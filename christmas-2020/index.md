### Joy To The World

Joy to the world, the Lord is come<br>
Let earth receive her King<br>
Let every heart prepare Him room<br>
And heaven and nature sing<br>
And heaven and nature sing<br>
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing<br>
<br>
Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns<br>
Let men their songs employ<br>
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains<br>
Repeat the sounding joy<br>
Repeat the sounding joy<br>
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy<br>
<br>
He rules the world with truth and grace<br>
And makes the nations prove<br>
The glories of His righteousness<br>
And wonders of His love<br>
And wonders of His love<br>
And wonders, wonders of His love<br>
And wonders, wonders of His love<br>

### Angels We Have Heard On High

Angels we have heard on high<br>
Sweetly singing o'er the plains<br>
And the mountains in reply<br>
Echoing their joyous strains<br>
<br>
Shepherds, why this jubilee<br>
Why yours joyous strains prolong?<br>
What the gladsome tidings be<br>
Which inspire your heavenly song?<br>
<br>
Gloria<br>
In excelsis deo<br>
<br>
Come to Bethlehem and see<br>
Him whose birth the angels Sing<br>
Come, adore on bended knee<br>
Christ, the Lord, the newborn King<br>

### O Come Let Us Adore Him

Oh, come, let us adore him<br>
Oh, come, let us adore him<br>
Oh, come, let us adore him<br>
Christ the Lord<br>
<br>
We give you all the glory<br>
We give you all the glory<br>
We give you all the glory<br>
Christ the Lord<br>
<br>
For You along are worthy<br>
For You along are worthy<br>
For You along are worthy<br>
Christ the Lord<br>


### Go Tell It On The Mountain

Go tell it on the mountain<br>
over the hills and everywhere<br>
Go tell it on the mountain<br>
that Jesus Christ is born.<br>
<br>
While shepherds kept their watching<br>
o'er silent flocks by night<br>
Behold throughout the heavens<br>
there shone a Holy Light<br>
<br>
The shepherds feared and trembled<br>
when lo! Above the earth<br>
Rang out the angel chorus<br>
that hailed our Saviour's birth<br>
<br>
Down in a lowly manger<br>
the humble Christ was born<br>
And brought us God's salvation<br>
that blessed Christmas morn<br>
