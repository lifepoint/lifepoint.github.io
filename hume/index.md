Dear Friends and Family,

I’m excited to share an opportunity that is very close to my heart. This summer, students will have the chance to attend Hume Lake Christian Camps – A place where fun, faith, and life-changing encounters with God come together in a powerful way.

Hume Lake is a high-energy camp filled with exciting recreation, friendly competition, outdoor adventures, and an abundance of activities that keep the fun going all week long. But beyond the fun, Hume Lake offers something even deeper—a chance to step away from the distractions of everyday life and enter into an intentional, Christ-centered community.

Through Biblically rich themes, Gospel-focused teaching, small group discussions, and powerful worship, students are challenged to grow in their relationship with God and equipped to live out their faith with grace and boldness. Hume Lake truly is the best of both worlds: an escape from regular routines while rediscovering the richness and depth that a life in Christ provides.

I am currently raising funds to help make this life-changing experience possible. Your support—whether through prayer or financial contribution—would directly impact students of LifePoint by helping cover camp costs and ensuring they can attend without financial burden.

Thank you for taking the time to consider partnering with me in this meaningful opportunity. Your generosity helps invest in the next generation’s spiritual growth, and I’m deeply grateful for your support.
