**Men's bible study: Tuesdays @ 7:00pm**

No bells and whistles, straight up bible study. Come join us every Tuesday night at the church office from 7-8pm. Be ready to engage and be challenged by Gods inerrant transforming Word.

Proverbs 27:17 “As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.”

Just a heads up: Men’s bible study breaks for the months of December and May-August for summer break

**Men's bible study: Fridays @ 5:30am**

Lots of coffee and God's word. Slow-paced study through books of the bible. Gather with other men to hear from God by reading and reflecting on the Bible.
