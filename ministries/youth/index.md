Our youth ministry exists to help students from 6th to 12th grade connect with God and each other. We love to have fun, build relationships, and grow closer to God together. We have fun experiences throughout the year such as summer camp, winter retreat, group games, and so much more where students can enjoy spending time with others their age in a safe environment. 

We also meet weekly in separate junior high and high school groups to study Godâ€™s word and discover his purpose for our lives. During this time, we also play games, eat snacks, and worship God. 
Here are our weekly meeting times:

**Junior High Youth Group - Lifeline**
- 6th-8th Grade
- Day: Sunday
- Time: 6:30pm-8:00pm

**High School Youth Group - The Point**
- 9th-12th Grade
- Day: Tuesday
- Time: 6:30pm-8:00pm

**Junior High Bible Study**
- 6th-8th Grade
- Day: Sunday (except 1st Sunday of the Month)
- Time: 10:00am

Here we study the attributes of God and what we believe as followers of Jesus.

**High School Sunday Morning Church Ditch Days**
- Day: Every 1st Sunday of the Month
- Time: 10:00am

HS Students will meet at the church and then head out to an offsite location
during the church service time with Harlan and/or another youth leader to learn
a new spiritual discipline to do on their own each month to grow closer to God. 

**High School Discipleship Group**
- Day: Sunday
- Time: 5:00-6:00

Here students dig deeper and learn why we believe what we believe, how to
defend their faith, and how to grow closer to God. This group of students will
be challenged to live out their faith. This can happen by serving at church as
student leaders on Sunday Night, playing in the youth worship band, helping in
the children's ministry, going on short term missions trips, and so much more.
This can also happen at home and at school and so students will be encouraged
to live out their faith no matter where they are. 

Please contact our Youth Pastor, Harlan Champoux at [lifepointyouthministry@gmail.com](mailto:lifepointyouthministry@gmail.com) if you have any questions. We would love to see you at youth group!
