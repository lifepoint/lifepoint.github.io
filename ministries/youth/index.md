Our youth ministry exists to help students from 6th to 12th grade connect with
God and each other. We love to have fun, build relationships, and grow closer
to God together. We have fun experiences throughout the year where students can enjoy
spending time with others their age in a safe environment. 

We also meet weekly in separate junior high and high school groups to study
Godâ€™s word and discover his purpose for our lives.

Here are our weekly meeting times:

**Junior High Youth Group - Lifeline**
- 6th-8th Grade
- Day: Monday
- Time: 6:30pm-8:00pm

**High School Youth Group - The Point**
- 9th-12th Grade
- Day: Tuesday
- Time: 6:30pm-8:00pm

**Junior High Bible Study**
