### FAQs
**Q. Can my child play soccer/baseball and flag football?**<br>
A.  We **highly recommend** your child participate in only one sport per season.  Both teams suffer when players cannot fully commit, and it makes it difficult for coaches to establish game play.  Oakdale Upward Sports will not make any special accommodations for multi-sport athletes.

**Q. Will there be a make-up picture day?**<br>
A. No.  There will only be 1 picture day. This date can be found in the Important Dates section on the website as well as in your registration confirmation email.

**Q. Can I request a coach or teammate?**<br>
A.  Coaches draft teams, therefore making it impossible for requests to be met.

**Q. Can I request a specific practice day?**<br>
A.  You can put in a request; however, practice days / times are at the coach’s discretion.  There is no guarantee we can accommodate your request.

**Q. What size football will be used during games?**<br>
A. 1st-2nd grade will use a Pee-Wee sized ball. 3rd-6th grade will use a Junior sized ball.

**Q. How long are evaluations?**<br>
A. Players are typically in and out of evaluations within 1 hour or less.

**Q. Can baseball cleats be worn in place of football cleats?**<br>
A. Yes, many players choose to wear their baseball cleats during the season.

**Q. Do all players have the same colored jersey?**<br>
